    Transmission Timeline
</h1>
 <p>
    This dashboard shows a line plot of the number of Taraf, Hadith, or Isnads for a select number of places and time period. 
     For a explanation of vocabulary, navigate to <a href="../about.html"> the About page</a> for a explanation of terminology and methodology.
     Need sentence explaining how numbers were calculated here.
    If the dashboard says "preparing space..." it is loading because it has not been used recently and must be reloaded. Give it a minute for it to load.
    In this plot you can isolate the timelines of specific places. Just double click the city on the legend (bottom right) and it will only
    show the line plot of that place. There are also helpful tools on the top left, like taking a screenshot, zooming and panning, etc. To select cities,
    use the dropdown option or type in the cities- assuming they are spelled correctly, they will show up. Same applies to the year options,
    you may type in the years. Please ensure the begining year is before the end year, there will be a error otherwise.
