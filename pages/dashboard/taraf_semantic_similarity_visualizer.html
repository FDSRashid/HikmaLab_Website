<h1>
    Taraf Semantic Similarity Visualizer
</h1>
 <p>
    This dashboard displays the similarity scores of all combinations of Hadith within a taraf as a matrix plot. So if you want to compare two hadith, you find the row of Hadith 1,
    then column of Hadith two. If the row and column are the same (diagonal elements), the score is always one as One hadith is just being compared to itself.
    The matrix plot is returned for a input taraf, as well as a histogram plot of the similarity scores (excluding diagonals and repeating scores). Finally, a table of the matns and matn info,
    alongside a index number called "Number" is displayed. The index can be used to easily find hadith from the matrix plot.
    If the dashboard says "preparing space..." it is loading because it has not been used and must be reloaded. Give it a minute for it to load.
