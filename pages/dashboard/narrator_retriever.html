<h1>
    Narrator Retriever
</h1>
 <p>
    This dashboard retrieves all the narrators within a time period and place. Specifically, it returns all the transmissions. So if narrator X
    trasmitted 20 Hadith to narrator Y, a single row will be displayed for all the transmissions that existed from X to Y. The teacher column is
    the transmitter and the student column is the recipient. You will also find the number of Hadith, Taraf, and Isnads between scholar X and Y in this 
    row. For a explanation of vocabulary, navigate to <a href="../about.html"> the About page</a> for a explanation of terminology and methodology. There is also
    a "Teacher Reports" and a "Student Reports" column. These are the total number of reports of that particular narrator.
    If the dashboard says "preparing space..." it is loading because it has not been used and must be reloaded. Give it a minute for it to load.
    To select cities,
    use the dropdown option or type in the cities- assuming they are spelled correctly, they will show up. Same applies to the year options,
    you may type in the years.
    Please ensure the begining year is before the end year, there will be a error otherwise.
