<h1>
    Network Visualizer
</h1>
 <p>
    This dashboard displays the whole network of narrators of a user defined time period and location.
    It can display the number of taraf, hadith, or number of isnads between a pair of narrators.
    For a explanation of vocabulary, navigate to <a href="../about.html"> the About page</a> for a explanation of terminology and methodology. 
    If the dashboard says "preparing space..." it is loading because it has not been used and must be reloaded. Give it a minute for it to load.
    To select cities,
    use the dropdown option or type in the cities- assuming they are spelled correctly, they will show up. Same applies to the year options,
    you may type in the years.
    Please ensure the begining year is before the end year, there will be a error otherwise. There is a limit for a number of narrators that can be shown.
    This is because the visualization library performs weaker with a really large network. For most use cases, a network with a thousand narrators or less will sufice.
    The narrators selected will be the pairs (edges) with the largest number of narrations between them, for a chosen value (Hadith, Isnad, Taraf.)
    If there are other metrics you would like to select edges from, please contact us!
