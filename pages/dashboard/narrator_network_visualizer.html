<h1>
    Narrator  Network Retriever
</h1>
 <p>
    This dashboard allows you to search up a name of the narrator within our database. If part of the input text is contained in the formal name
    or famous name of the narrator, that narrator and the relevant information will be returned in a table. Note, RAWI ID is the id used in the next 
    tab of the dashboard. On the top left of the dashboard is a tab that allows you to use the acompanying tool, the network visualizer. For a given time period 
    you can visualize the network of all the teachers and students of a narrator alongside relevant information. 
    If the dashboard says "preparing space..." it is loading because it has not been used and must be reloaded. Give it a minute for it to load.
