        Tools for Researchers
    </h2>

    <p>
        We have developed a variety of tools for researchers, scholars, and the general public to use and
        benefit from them. The dashboards are tools to visualize and summarize trends in Hadith transmission. 
        They utilize the largest Sunni collection of digitized Hadith to date: the Gawamiâ€™ Kalim dataset.
        Housing over 1500 books of Hadith, Law and Theology, over 800,000 reports alongside
        their isnads and a collection of 50,000 narrator bios, the data presented
        in the dashboards is by far the most comprehensive coverage of Sunni Hadith.
        Furthermore, some of these dashboards have not yet been visualized by any previous effort, providing means to new forms of analysis.
        The models developed are used to efficiently conduct a specific task for a large corpus of Hadith. For example, QulBERT is the first
        transformer model trained on the Gawami Kalim dataset for tasks relating to semantic similarity. Search engines, clustering, semantic classification are 
        examples of tasks that can be done with QulBERT, for effective results. We have also shared a myriad of papers resulting from analysis using the tools and research by this project.
