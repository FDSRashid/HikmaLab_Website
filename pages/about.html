    About this project: We aim to present analytics about Hadith collections that are comprehensive yet rigorous.
     One of the pitfalls of the data scientific revolution is that there are molds of people who are experts in
      analyzing data using methods within data science yet lack prerequisite domain knowledge to make truly
       informed decisions using the tools provided by data scientists. We aim to bridge that gap by developing 
       tools forged in a grounded understanding of Hadith Sciences, its intersection with digital humanities 
       and social network analysis, as well as providing the most comprehensive coverage of Hadith collections.

<p>


 This repository utilizes the largest Sunni collection of digitized Hadith to
 date: the Gawamiâ€™ Kalim dataset. Housing over 1500 books of Hadith, 
 Law and Theology, over 800,000 reports alongside their isnads and a 
 collection of 50,000 narrator bios, the information presented through this 
 project is by far the most comprehensive coverage of Sunni Hadith.

    The project will present tools to assist researchers, scholars, and the general public
  in deriving informed decisions about the world of Hadith. They come in the form of a
  variety of dashboards visualizing unique trends of Hadith dispersion throughout the
   Muslim world and Islamic history, language models trained and proven to be effective
    for Hadith-related tasks, and a repository of papers and analysis utilizing the resources at hand.
